## Room Allocation System

The hostel has 12 floors with specific allocation rules:

- Each room should have students of the same year
- Each floor should have students of the same year only
- Floor allocation by year:
  - Floors 1-2: 1st year students
  - Floors 3-5: 3rd year students
  - Floors 6-9: 4th year students
  - Floors 10-12: 2nd year students
- Room numbering follows the pattern:
  - First floor: 101-139
  - Second floor: 201-239
  - And so on up to 12th floor: 1201-1239
- Rooms on 10th, 11th, and 12th floors follow a different pattern:
  - 10th floor: 1001, 1011, 1021, 1031, etc.
  - 11th floor: 1101, 1111, 1121, 1131, etc.
  - 12th floor: 1201, 1211, 1221, 1231, etc.
- Room capacity varies:
  - Rooms ending with 36: 2-sharing
  - Rooms ending with 37: 3-sharing
  - Rooms ending with 38: 3-sharing
  - Rooms ending with 39: 2-sharing

## Technology Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

#### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=4000
   DBURL=mongodb://localhost:27017/hostel-management
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
   CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

#### Admin Client Setup
1. Navigate to the admin-client directory:
   ```bash
   cd admin-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Student Client Setup
1. Navigate to the student-client directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Real-Time Chat Feature

The system includes a real-time chat feature using Socket.IO:

- Real-time messaging between students and administrators
- Image sharing in messages
- Admin messages highlighted with an admin tag
- Student messages display student name and profile image
- Message history persistence

## Data Generation

For testing purposes, the system can generate male student test data:
- Emails follow the pattern: [year]071a[random]@vnrvjiet.in (e.g., 23071a6685@vnrvjiet.in for 2nd year)
- Students are distributed across branches: CSE, CSE-AIML, CSE-DS, CSE-CYS, AIDS, MECH, EEE, ECE, CIVIL, AE, IT, CSBS
- Default password: 1234
- Rooms are automatically updated with allocated students
